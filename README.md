## Laboratory Works

### Lab 1 – Regular Grammar and Finite Automaton

Variant: 11

Description:  
Implementation of a regular grammar and its transformation into a finite automaton.  
The program generates valid strings based on the grammar rules and verifies string acceptance using the constructed automaton.

### Lab 2 – Determinism in Finite Automata
Variant: 11

Description:
Implementation of a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NDFA) and its conversion into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the subset construction method.  
The laboratory work also includes conversion of a finite automaton into a regular grammar, verification of automaton determinism, and grammar classification according to the Chomsky hierarchy.
